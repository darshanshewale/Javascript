    <h1>javascript var</h1>
    <pre>javascript var statement is used to declare variable in javascript are funciton-scoped.The var statement is also used to declare global scope
        variables.

        before the introduction of ES6 all the keywords in javascript were declared with only the "var" keyword
    </pre>

    <h1>Function Scope</h1>
    <pre>The variable declared inside a funcition are function scoped and can not be accessed outside the function the variables declard with
        var  can only be accessed inside that function and its enclosing function
    </pre>
    <pre>
        The variables declared using the var statement are hoisted at the top are initialized befor the execution of code with a defualt value of 
        undefined the variables declared in the global scope that is global scope that is outside any function can not be deleted 
    </pre>

    <p>Declare global variable and access it anywhere insiden the program </p>

    <script>
        var test =12;
        function foo()
        {
            console.log(test);
        }
        foo();
    </script>

    <p>We  will declared multiple variables in a single statement </p>

    <script>
        var test1=12,
        test2=34,
        test3=22
        function myfun()
        {
            console.log(test1,test2, test3);
        }
        myfun();
    </script>

    <p>The hoisting of variables declared using var</p>

    <script>
        console.log(p);
        var p=22;   

        // output without error becuase the variable test is hoisted at the top even before the execution of the program began and the variable  is 
        // initialized with a default value of undefined 
    </script>

    <p>In this example we will redeclare a variable in the same global block </p>

    <script>
        var a1=12;
        var a1=14;
        console.log(a1);

        // we did not get any error when redeclaring the variable if we did the the same with the let keyword an error would be thrown
    </script>

    <p>
        redeclare the variabvle in another scope and see how it is the original variable
    </p>

    <script>
        var r=12;
        function r1()
        {
            var r=123;
            console.log(r);
        }
        r1();
        console.log(r);

        // did not get the any error while redeclaring the variable inside another function scope and the original value of 
        // the variable preserved
    </script>

    <p>
        will try to delete a global variable declared using va in the 'use strict ' mode
    </p>
     <script>
        'use strict';
        var t=33;
        delete (t);
        console.log(t);
     </script>

     whenever a variable is declared using var in global scope it can not be configured Hence it can not be deleted using the 
     delete keyword and an error is thrown
