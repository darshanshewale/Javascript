    <h1>Let</h1>
    <pre>
        Javascript let is keyword used to declare variables that are block scoped variables defined with the let keyword can not be redeclared 
        and must be declared before use.

        let keyword was added in the es6 or es2015 version of javascript generally it is suggest that we  use the let keyword while working with 
        javascript
    </pre>

<h1>Block scoped </h1>
<pre>
    The variable which are declared inside the {} block are known as block-scoped variables  declared by the var keyword can not be 
    block-scoped
</pre>

<script>
    {
        let num=10;
        console.log(num);

    }
    console.log(num);
    // given an refernce erro as block element tried to acces outside the block 

    
</script>

<h1>Global Scope</h1>
<pre>
    A global scope variable is a variable declared in the main body of the source code, outside all functions
</pre>
<script>
    let num=10;
    console.log(num)

    function fun()
    {
        console.log(num);
    }
    fun();
</script>

<h1>Function Scope</h1>
<pre>
    A function scope variable is a variable declared inside  a function and can not be accessed outside the function
</pre>

<script>
    function fun()
    {
        let n=10;
        console.log(n);
    }
    fun()
    console.log(n);
    // this will give refrence error as accessed outside the scope
</script>

<h1>redeclaring variables in different blocks</h1>
The variables declared using let can be redeclared inside other blocks

<script>
    let x=77;
    {
        let x=23;
        console.log(x);
    }
    console.log(x);
</script>

<h1>redeclaring variables in the same block</h1>
We can not redeclare variable using the let keyword inside the same block it will throw an error

<script>
     let z=77;
     {
        let z=23;
        console.log(x);

     }
     let z=67;
     console.log(x);
    //  This will throw error variable x is redeclared inside the same block 
</script>

<h1>Does not support Hoisting</h1>
<pre>
    The behaviour of moving the declarations on top of the script is know as hoisting 
</pre>

<script>
    x=12;
    console.log(x)
    let x;
</script>
