    <h1>javascript weakmap</h1>
    <pre>
        javascript weakmap is used to store a collection of key-value pairs that are weekly referenced which means if garbages collection
        is possible it would not be prevented. In a weakmap the key are strictly objects but values can be any primitive Javascript Data type 
        A weakMap is not enumerable as the reference are loose. Weakmaps are mainly used to store extra data where cleaning of memory 
        does not affect the program much 

        <b>parameter</b>
        <b>iter</b> It is an iterable javascript object that implements the @@iterator Method. It contains two elements where the first is
        key and the second is value
