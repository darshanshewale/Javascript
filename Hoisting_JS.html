    <h1>Hoisting</h1>
    <pre>
        Concept that enables us to extract values of variables and functions even before initialization/assigning value without getting errors
        and this happens during the 1st phase (memory creation Phase) of the execution context

        <b>features of hoisting </b>
        @In javascript Hositing is the default behaviour of moving all the declarations at the top of the scope before code execution 
        bascially it gives us an advantage that no matter where functions and variables are delcared they are moved to the top of their scope
        regardless of whether their scope is globale or local 
        @It allows us to call functions beofore ven writing them in our code
