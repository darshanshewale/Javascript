    <h1>Function in Javascript</h1>
    <pre>
        javascript Function is a set of statement that take input do some specific computation and produce output
    </pre>
    <p>A javscript function is executed when "something" invokes it(calles it)</p>

    <script>
        function multiply() {
            let num1 = 10;
            let num2 = 20;

            let mul = num1 * num2;
            document.write(mul);
        }
        multiply();

    </script>

    <h1> Function Invocation</h1>
    <pre>
        @triggered by an event(e.g a button clieck by user )
        @when explicitly called from javascript code 
        @Automatically executed,such as self-invoking functions
    </pre>

    <h4>There are three ways of writing a function in javascript</h4>

    <h5>Function Declaration</h5>
    <pre>
        It declares a function with function keyowrd The function declaration must have a function name</pre>

    <script>
        function HW() {
            document.write("hello World");
        }
        HW();
    </script>

    <h5>Function Expression</h5>

    <pre>
        It is similar to function declaration without the function name fucntion expression cab be stored in a variable assigment 
    </pre>

    <script>
        let fun = function (num1, num2) {
            let ans = num1 * num2;

            return ans;
        }
        let a = fun(3, 4);
        document.write(a);
    </script>

    <h5>Arrow Function</h5>
    <pre>
            It is one of the most used and efficient methods to create a function in javascript becuase of its compartively easy implementation
            it is a simplified as well as more compact version of a regular or normal function expression or syntax
          </pre>

    <script>

        let division = (n1, n2) => { return n1 / n2 };
        let d = division(10, 5);
        console.log(d);

    </script>

    <h1>types of function in javascript</h1>

    <h3>Named Function</h3>
    <pre>
            Named function:A named function is one that we write in code and then use whenever we need it by refrencing its name and providing
            it with some parameters.named Functions come in handy when we need to call a fucntion servral times to give  various to it or run it multiple times
            
        </pre>

    <h3>Anonymous function</h3>
    <pre>
            We can define a function in javacript withour giving it a name This nameless ufnction is refreed to as the Anonymous
            fucntion A variable must be assigned to an Anonymous fucntion
        </pre>

    <h3>Nested function</h3>
    <pre>
            A function in javascript can contain one or more inner function These nested fucntions fall within the purview of the outer function
            The inner fucntion has access to the variable and arguments of outer function However variables declared within inner fucntions
            cannot be accessed by outer functions

            <script>
                function msg(name) {
                    function hey() {
                        console.log("hey" + name);
                    }

                    return hey();

                }
                msg("ravi");
            </script>
        </pre>

    <h3>Immediately invoked function expression</h3>

    <pre>
            The browser executes the invoked fucntion  experession as soon as it detects it this function has the advantage of runnning instantly 
            where it is situated in the code and producing direct output.That is it is unaffected by code that occurs later in the script and can be 
            beneficial.
    </pre>

    <script>
        let m = (function () {
            return "welcome fo gfg";
        })();
        console.log(m);

    </script>


    <h1>Javascript Function Call</h1>
    <pre>
    The javascript Function call is a predefinced javascript method that is used to write method for different objects It calls The method 
    taking the owner objects as an argument.The keyword this refers to the "owner" of the function or the object it belongs to all the function
    in javscript are considered object mehtods so we can bind a function to a particular object by using call() A function will be the global object 
    if the function is not considered a method of a javascript objects

    return value: it calls and returns a method with the owner object being the argument 
</pre>

    <script>
        function product(a, b) {
            return a * b;
        }

        let result = product.call(this, 20, 4);
        console.log(result);
    </script>

    <!-- this function calls with arguments  -->
    <script>

        let employee = {
            details: function (designation, experience) {
                return this.name
                    + " "
                    + this.id
                    + designation
                    + experience;
            }
        }
        let emp1 = {
            name: "A",
            id: "123",
        }
        let emp2 = {
            name: "B",
            id: "456",
        }

        let x = employee.details.call(emp2, "manager", "4 years");
        console.log(x);
    </script>

    <!-- Thie example decribes binding a function to an object  -->
    <script>
        let obj =
        {
            a: 12,
            b: 13,
        };

        function sum() {
            return this.a + this.b;
        }
        console.log(sum.call(obj));
    </script>

    <h1>Difference between method and Functions in javascript</h1>

    <pre>
        <b>Javscript Function</b> is a block of code written to perform some spcicific set of task we can define a function using 
        the function keyword followed by Name and optional parameters they body of the function is enclosed in curly braces

        <b>javscript Method</b> is a property of an object that contains a function definition method are functions stores as object properties
        object method can be accessed with the following syntax
    </pre>

    <script>
        let data={
            empname:"rahul",
            details:function()
            {
                return this.empname;
            }
        };
        console.log(data.details());
    </script>
