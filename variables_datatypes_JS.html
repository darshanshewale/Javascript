    <h1>Variable and Datatypes in java script</h1>

    <h1>variables</h1>
    <pre>
        In javascript,variables are used to store and manage data they created using var, let or const keyword;
    </pre>
    <h2>var</h2>
    Declares a variable It has a function-scoped or globally-scoped behaviour

    var x=10;

    <script>
        var a = "hello Coder";
        var b = 10;
        var c = 12;
        var d = c + b;

        console.log(a);
        console.log(b);
        console.log(c);
        console.log(d);
    </script>

    <h2>let</h2>
    Introduces Block-scoped variables It commonly used for variables that may change their value
    ley y="hello";

    <script>
        let x = "hello lerners";
        let y = "joining"
        let z = '12';
        let m = y + z;

        console.log(x);
        console.log(y);
        console.log(z);
        console.log(m);
    </script>

    <h2>Const</h2>
    Declares variables that cannot be reassigned It's block scoped as well

    <script>
        const h = "happy coding";
        console.log(h);

        const i = 200;
        console.log(b);

        const j = "12";
        console.log(c);
    </script>

    <h1>Data types</h1>
    <pre>
        javascript is a dynamically typed(also called lossely typed ) scripting language. In javascript, variables can receive different 
        data types over time. The latest ECMA scripts standard defines eight data types out of which seven data types are primitive(predefined)
        and one complex or Non primitive

    </pre>

    <h1>Primitive Data Types </h1>
    The predefined data types provided by javascript lanaguage are know as primitive data types also know as built in
    data types
    <pre>
        @Number: javascript numbers are always stores in double precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 unlike other programming 
        languages you do't need int,float etc to declare differnt numeric value
        @string: javascript strings are similar to sentences they are made up of a list characters, which is essentially just an arry of characters
        like "Hello Greekforgreeks" etc
        @Boolean: Represent a logical entity and can have two values: true or false
        @NULL: This type has only one value that is NULL
        @Undefined: A variable that has not been assigned a value is Undefined
        @Symbol: Symbol return unique identifiers that can be used to add unique property keys to an object that won't collide with keys of any other code 
         that might add to the object 
         @Bigint:BigInt is a Built-in-object in javascript that provides a way to represent whole numbers larger than 253-1

    </pre>

    <h1>Non primitive Data types</h1>
    <pre>
        The Data Types that are derived from primitive data types  of the java script language are known as no primitve data types .
        it is also known as derived data types or refernce data types 
        @Object It is the most important data type and forms the building blocks for modern javascript we will learn about these data types 
        in details in further articles 
        
    </pre>

    <h1>Global and Local variables in javascript</h1>
    <h1>Global variable</h1>
    <pre>
        These are variables that are defined in global scope i.e outside of function These vaiables have a global scope so they can be accessed
        by any function directly In the case of global scope variables the keyword they are declared with does not matter they all act the same
        A variable declared without a keyword is also considered global even though it is declared in the function
    </pre>
    <h1>Local variables</h1>
    <pre>
        when you use javascript local variable are variables that are defined within functions they have local scope which means
        that they can only be used within the function that define them accessing them outside the funtion will throw an error
    </pre>

    <script>
        let petName = 'Rocky'
        myFunction()

        function myFunction() {
            fruit = 'apple'; // Considered global
            console.log(typeof petName +
                '- ' +
                'My pet name is ' +
                petName)
        }

        console.log(
            typeof petName +
            '- ' +
            'My pet name is ' +
            petName +
            'Fruit name is ' +
            fruit)

            anotherfunction()


            function anotherfunction()
         {
            let petName='Tom';
            console.log(petName);

         }
         console.log(petName)

    </script>

    Note : use local variable whenever possible Always use the var keyword to declare a new global variable and always declare a variable before
    you refer to it in your code
