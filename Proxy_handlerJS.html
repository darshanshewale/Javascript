    <h1>Javascript proxy</h1>
    <pre>
        Javascript proxy is an object which intercepts another object and resists the fundamental operations on it.
        This object is mostly used when we want to hide information abut one object from unauthorized access.

        A  proxy consists of two parts which are its target and handler. A target is a javascript object on which the 
        proxy is applied and the handler object contains the function to intercept any other operaration on it 

        <b>parameters</b>
        <b>tar</b> it is the object on which the proxy is to be applied
        <b>handle</b> it is the object in which the intercept condition is defined 

    </pre>
    <!-- #method applied  aproxy object with an empty handler -->
    <script>
        let details={
            name:"Raj",
            course:"DSA",
        }
        const prox = new Proxy(details,{})

        console.log(prox.name);
        console.log(prox.course);
    </script>
    <!-- Method applies a handler function to intercept calls on the target object  -->
    <script>
        let det=
        {
            name:"Raj",
            course:"DSA",
        }
        const p=new Proxy(det,{get:function(){
            return "unauthorized";
        }
    })

    console.log(p.name);
    console.log(p.course);
    </script>

    <!-- method traps calls on the target object based on the condition  -->

            name:'Rahul',
            course:'HTML',

        {
