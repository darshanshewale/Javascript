    <h1>javascript Operator</h1>
    <pre>javascript operator operate the operands thse are symbols that are used to manipulate a certain value or 
        operand operator are used to performing specific mathmatical and logical computation on operands 

        In javascript operators are used to compare values perform arithmetic operations etc

    <h4>javascript Ternary Operators</h4>
    <pre>
        javascript Ternary Operator (conditional Operator) is a concise way to write a conditional (if else statement Ternary operator takes
        Operator takes three operands i.e condition true value and false value)

        Operands: 
        Codition : Expresssion to be evaluted which returns a boolean value
        value if true : value to be executed of the condition results in a true state 
        value if false: value to be executed if the condition results in a false state  

        characteristics of ternary operator 
        @The Expresssion consists of three operands : the condition value if true and value if false
        @the evalution of the condition should result in either a true/false or a boolean value
        @the true value lies between "?" & ":" and is executed if the condition returns true similarly 
        the false value lies after ":" and is executed if the condition returns false
    </pre>
    <script>
        let j = (5 < 6) ? "True" : "false";
        document.write(j);
    </script>

    <h4>javascript Comma Operators</h4>
    <p>Comma operator mainly eveluates its operands from left to right sequentially nd returns the value of the
        rightmost operand</p>

    <h4>Unary Operator: typeof ,Delete </h4>

    <pre>In Javascript the typeof operator returns the data type of its operands in the form of a string The operands can be any object function
        or variable

        Operand is an expression reprsenting the object or primitive whose type is to be returned the possible types exist in javascript are
    </pre>

    <h1>javascript Delete operator</h1>

    <pre>
        The mainpurpose is to remove a property from an object
    </pre>

    <pre></pre>

    <script>
        let q = 404;
        let r = 'HappyCOding';
        document.write(typeof q);
        document.write(typeof r);

        let emp = {
            firstname: "raj",
            lastname: "kiran",
            salary: "333",
        }
        document.write(delete emp.salary);
        console.log(emp);
    </script>

    <h4>Javascript Relational operators</h4>
    <pre>Javascript Realational Operator are used to compare its operands and determine the realationship between them 
        They return a Boolean value(true or false) based on the comparison result
    </pre>

    <h1>Javascript in operator</h1>
    <pre>
        Javascript in operator is an inbuilt operator which is used to check whether a particular property exists in an object or not 
        It returns a boolean value true if the specified property is in an object otherwise it returns false

        parameter
        prop: This parameter holds the string or symbol that reprsents a property name or array index
        object: This parameter is an object that is to be checked whether it contains the prop 

        return value
        This method returns a boolean value the value true is returned if the specified property is found in an object else it returns false

        
    </pre>
    

    <script>
        let car = {
            make: 'toyata',
            madel: 'fortunar',
            year: 2022
        };

        let hasmake = "make" in car;
        let hascolor = 'color' in car;
        document.write(hasmake);
        document.write(hascolor); 
    </script>

    <h4>Javascript Bigint Operators</h4>
    <pre>Most operator that ca be used between numbers can be used between bigint values as well</pre>

    <h4>javascript String Operator </h4>
    <pre>Concagtenation operator(+)</pre>

    <script>
        let str1 = "Hello";
        let str2 = "Coder";
        let result = (str1 + str2);
        document.write(result);
    </script>

    <h1>Operator precedance in Javascript</h1>
    <pre>Operator precedance refers to the priority given to operators while parsing a statement that has more than one operator performing operations
        in it Operators with higher priorities are resolved first but as goes down the list the priorty decreases and hence their resolution 

        The precedence of the multiple(*) and divide operator is the same but due to assiociativity from left to right the multiply operator
        will be resolved first as it comes first when we go from left to right . 

         
    </pre>

    <h1>javascript yield Operator</h1>
    <pre>
        Javascript yield operator is used to delegate control of a generator function to another generator function or iterable object 
        It allows you to yield the value of an inner generator or iterable object from within an outer generator function . This operator 
        is useful in varity of scenario such as whne working with iterator asynchronously processing data pr implementating coroutines

        only the generator function it's included in call yield directly nested functions and callbacks are not permiited to invoke it

        The next function() of the generator returns an iterator result object with the properties value and is done when the yield keyword is used
        to invoke the method The generator function has not entirely finished running while done is false as seen by the value property which is the outcome
        of evaluting the yield expression 

        syntax 
        [rv]=yield [expression] 

        expression: this defines the value that the generator function will return vai the iterator protocol
        rv : it returns the optional value that was supplied to the generator's next function so that is may carry on with its execution 
    </pre>

    

    <h1>Javascript pipeline Operator</h1>
    <pre>The javascript Pipeline operator (|>) is used to pipe the value of an expression into a function This operator makes chained functionmore redabel  </pre>


    <h1>Javascript Grouping operator</h1>

    <pre>The grouping operator consists of a pair of parentheses around an expression or sub expression to overide the normal 
        oprator operator precedence so that expression with lower precedance can be evaluated before an expression with higher priority
        This operator can only contains expression the parameter list is passed to a function within this operator which will treat it as an expression

    </pre>

    <script>
        function group()
        {
            let value1=3 * (2 + 3);
            let value2=( 3 + 2) * 3;
            document.write(value1);
            document.write(value2);
        }
        group();
