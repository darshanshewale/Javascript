    <h1>Async/Await Function in Javascript</h1>
    <pre>
        javascript is synchronous in nature which means that it has an event loop that allows to queue up an actio that won't take place until 
        the loop is avialble sometime after the code that queued the action has finished executing but there are a lot of functionalities in our 
        program that make our code Asynchronous and one of them is Async/Await functionality 
    </pre>

    <h1>Async Function</h1>
    <pre>
        Async simple allows us to write promises-based code as if it was synchronous and it checks that we are not breaking the execution thread

    </pre>

    <script>
        const getdata=async()=>{
            let data="hello world";
            return data;

        }
        getdata().then(data=>console.log(data));
    </script>


    <h1>Await Function</h1>
    <pre>
        Await Function is used to wait for the promise. It could be used within the async block only.It makes 
        the code wait until the promise returns a result 
    </pre>

    <script>
        const data=async()=>
        {
            let y=await "hello coders";
           console.log(y);
        }
        console.log(1);
        data();
        console.log(2);
    </script>
