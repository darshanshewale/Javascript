    <h1>Object Oriented Programming in Javascript</h1>

    <h2>Object</h2>
    <pre>
        An object is unique entity that contains properties and methods for example " a car " is a real life Object which has some characteristics
        like color,type,model and horsepower and performs certain actions like driving.The characteristics of an object are called properties in opp
        and the action are called methods An object is an instance of a class 

        Note: A method in javascript is a property of an object whose value is a function

        The object can be created in two ways in javascript:
        @Object Literal
        @Object Constructor
    </pre>

    <h2>Object Literal</h2>
    <script>
      let person = {
        first_name: "Mukul",
        last_name: "latiyan",

        getfunction: function () {
          return `The name of the person is ${person.first_name} ${person.last_name}`;
        },

        phone_number: {
          mobile: "1234",
          landline: "4545",
        },
      };
      console.log(person.getfunction());
      console.log(person.phone_number.landline);
    </script>

    <h2>Object Constructor</h2>
    <script>
      function person1(first_name, last_name) {
        this.first_name = first_name;
        this.last_name = last_name;
      }

      let person2 = new person1("Mukul", "latiyan");
      let person3 = new person1("Rahul", "Avsthi");

      console.log(person2.first_name);
      console.log(`${person3.first_name} ${person3.last_name}`);
    </script>
    <h4>
      Note: The javascript Object.create() method creates a new object,using an
      existing object as the prototype of the newly created object
    </h4>

    <script>
      const coder = {
        study: false,
        printInto: function () {
          console.log(`My name is ${this.name}.Am I studying?:${coder.study}.`);
        },
      };

      const me = Object.create(coder);

      me.name = "Kohali";
      me.study = true;
      me.printInto();
    </script>

    <h1>Classes</h1>
    <pre>
        Classes are blueprints of object A class can have many Objects because the class is a template while objects are instances of the class
        or the concrete implementation before we move further into implementation we should know unlike other object oriented languages there are 
        no classes in javascript we have only object To be more precise javacript is a prototype-based object oriented language which means it doesn't 
        have classes rather it defines behaviour using a constructor function and then reuses it using the prototype.
    </pre>

    <p>
      use ES6 classes then we will look at the traditional way of defining an
      object and simulate them as classes
    </p>

    <script>
      class vehicle {
        constructor(name, maker, engine) {
          this.name = name;
          this.maker = maker;
          this.engine = engine;
        }
        getDetails() {
          return `The name of the bike is ${this.name}.`;
        }
      }

      let bike = new vehicle("splendor", "honda", "125cc");
      let bike1 = new vehicle("pulsar", "bajaj", "150cc");

      console.log(bike.name);
      console.log(bike1.maker);
      console.log(bike1.getDetails());
    </script>

    <b>Abstraction</b>
    <pre>
            Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to providing only 
            essential information about the data to the outside world,hiding the background detials or implementation.
        </pre
    >

    <b>Encapsulation</b>
    <pre>
            The process of wrapping properties and function within a single unit is known as Encapsulation
        </pre
    >

    <script>
      class my {
        constructor(name, age) {
          this.name = name;
          this.age = age;
        }
        add_address(add) {
          this.add = add;
        }
        getDetails() {
          console.log(`Name is ${this.name},address is:${this.add}`);
        }
      }

      let a1 = new my("rahul", "23");
      a1.add_address("pune");
      a1.getDetails();
    </script>

    <pre>
            Encapsulation refers to the hiding of data or data abstraction which means representing essential features hiding the background
            detail Most of the OOP languages provide access modifiers to restrict the scope of a variable but there are no such access modifiers
            in javascript there are certain ways by which we can restrict the scope of variables within the Class/Object
        </pre
    >

    <script>
      function p(fname, lname) {
        this.first_name = fname;
        this.last_name = lname;

        let getDetails_noaccess = function () {
          return `First name is : ${first_name} Last name is:${last_name}`;
        };

        this.access = function () {
          return `First name is : ${fname}, Last name is: ${lname}`;
        };
      }

      let p1 = new p("rakesh", "rajesh");
      console.log(p1.first_name);
      console.log(p1.getDetails_noaccess);
      console.log(p1.access());
    </script>

    <h1>Inheritance</h1>
    <pre>
            It is a concept in which some properties and method of an object are being used by another object unlike most of the OOP
            languages where classes inherit classes javascript objects inherit objects , features of one object can be reused by other 
            objects
        </pre
    >

    <script>
      class d1 {
        constructor(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }
        toString() {
          return `Name of person: ${this.name}`;
        }
      }
      class student extends d1 {
        constructor(name, id) {
          super(name);
          this.id = id;
        }
        toString() {
          return `${super.toString()},
		Student ID: ${this.id}`;
        }
      }
      let student1 = new student("Mukul", 22);
      console.log(student1.toString());
    </script>

    <pre>
        Note:the person and student Objects have the same menthod(i.e tostring()),this is called Method Overiding .Mehtod Overiding allows 
        a method in a child class to have the same name(polymorphism) and menthod signature as that of a parent class.
    </pre>

    <pre>
        polymorphism: polymorphism is one of the core concept of object oriented programming languages Ploymorphism means the same function
        with different signatures is called many times.Polymorphism can be achieved by method Overiding and method obverloading
