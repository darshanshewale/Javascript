    <h1>javascript Numbers</h1>
    <pre>
        javascript Numbers are primitve data types javascript numbers are always stores in double precision 64 bit binary format IEEE754
        This  format stores numbers in 64 bits
        @0-51 bit stores value(fraction)
        @52-62 n=bit stores exponent
        @63-bit stores sing

        <b>Number Literals</b>:The types of number literals you can use decimal,binary,octal and hexadecimal

        <b>Number Coercian</b>The built-in-operation of javascript that expect numbers coerce their arguments to numbers list 
        @undefined is returned as NAN
        @null is returned as 0
        @true as 1 and false as 0
        @string are returned by parsing them as if they contain an object literal if the string is not parse it returns NaN
        @BignInts and sympbol throw typeerror

        <b>Interger Conversion</b>some operation such as those which work with an array,string, indexes or date/time expect integers 
        After performing the coercion if the number is greater than 0 it is returned as the same and if the number NAN or -0 it is returned 
        as 0 The result is always an integer.

        <b>Fixed width integer</b>In javascript there are some functions that deal with the binary encoding of integers such as bitwise 
        operators and typedArray objects.The bitwise operators always convert the operands to 32-bit intergers     

        <h4>Creates a Number Object</h4>
         <script>
            let n=new Number(4);
            console.log(n);
