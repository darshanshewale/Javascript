<h1>Strict Mode in Javascript</h1>
<pre>
    Strict Mode was a new feature in ECMAscript 5 that allows you to place a program or a function in a "strict" operating context. This strict context prevents certain
    actions from being taken and throws more exceptions.The Statement "Use strict"; instructs the browser to use the strict mode 
</pre>
<pre>Benefits of using 'use strict':Strict mode makes several changes to normal javascript semantics
    @strict mode eliminates some javascript silent error by changing them to throw errors
    @strict mode fixes mistakes that make it difficult for javascript engines to perform optimizations:strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than
    identical code that's not strict mode
    @strict mode prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAscript
    @It prevents or throws errors when relatively "unsafe" actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object)
    @it disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out 
    @strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" Javascript.
</pre>

<h1>How to use stric mode</h1>
<pre>
    @used in global scope for the entire script 
    @It can be applied to individual functions
