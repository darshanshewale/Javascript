    <h1>Loops in javascript</h1>

    <pre>
        Looping in programming languages is a feature that facilitate the execution of set of instruction/function repeatedly
        while some condition evaluates to true 
    </pre>

    <h1>While Loop</h1>

    <pre>
        A while loop is control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given boolean condition The while loop can
        be though of as a repeating if statment 
        
        1)While loop starts with checking the condition. If it is evaluated to be true, then the loop body statements are executed
        otherwise first statement following the loop is executed. For this reason, it is also called the Entry control loop
        2)Once the condition is evaluated to be true, the statements in the loop body are executed. Normally the statements contain 
        an updated value for the variable being processed for the next iteration.
        3)When the condition becomes false, the loop terminates which marks the end of its life cycle.
    </pre>

    <script>
        let i=0;
        while(i<5)
        {
            document.write(i);
            i++;
        }
    </script>

    <h1>For loop</h1>

    <pre>
        for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization,
        condition, and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy-to-debug structure of looping. 

        1)Initialization condition: Here, we initialize the variable in use. It marks the start of a for loop.
        An already declared variable can be used or a variable can be declared, local to loop only.
        2)Testing Condition: It is used for testing the exit condition for a loop. It must return a boolean value.
        It is also an Entry Control Loop as the condition is checked prior to the execution of the loop statements.
        3)Statement execution: Once the condition is evaluated to be true, the statements in the loop body are executed.
        4)Increment/ Decrement: It is used for updating the variable for the next iteration.
        5)Loop termination: When the condition becomes false, the loop terminates marking the end of its life cycle.
    </pre>

    <script>
        for(let i=0;i<5;i++)
        {
            document.write(i);
        }
    </script>

    <h1>Do..while</h1>
    <pre>
        The do-while loop is similar to the while loop with the only difference is that it checks for the condition after executing the statements,
         and therefore is an example of an Exit Control Loop. 

        1)The do-while loop starts with the execution of the statement(s). There is no checking of any condition for the first time.
        2)After the execution of the statements and update of the variable value, the condition is checked for a true or false value.
        If it is evaluated to be true, the next iteration of the loop starts.
        3)When the condition becomes false, the loop terminates which marks the end of its life cycle.
        4)It is important to note that the do-while loop will execute its statements at least once before any condition is checked 
            and therefore is an example of the exit control loop.
    </pre>

    <script>
        let j=0;
        do
        {
            document.write(j);
            j++;
        }while(j<6);

    </script>

    <h1>Infinite Loop</h1>
    <pre>
        One of the most common mistakes while implementing any sort of looping is that it may not ever exit, 
        i.e. the loop runs for infinite times. This happens when the condition fails for some reason. 
    </pre>

    <h1>For in </h1>
    <pre>
        for in loop in javascript is used to iterate over the properties of an object.The for-in loop iterates only over those keys of 
        an object which have their enumerable property set to true 
    </pre>

    <script>
        let myobj={x:1 ,y:2,z:3};
        for (let key in myobj)
        {
            document.write(key ,myobj[key]);
        }
    </script>

    <h1>For Of </h1>
    <pre>
        This loop is used to iterate the iterable objects for e.g. array, object, set and map. It directly iterate the value of the given
        iterable object and has more concise syntax than for loop.
    </pre>

    <script>
        let arr=[1,2,3,4]
        for(let value of arr)
        {
            document.write(value); 
        }
    </script>

    <h1>Javascript Map Loop</h1>
    <pre>A map loop is method on arrays that created a new array  by executing a function on each element in the array </pre>

    <script>
        const a=[1,2,3];
        const newArr=arr.map(val=>val *2);
        console.log(newArr);
    </script>
