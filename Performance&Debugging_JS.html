        1)Use fast DOM traversal with docuemtn.getelementbyID()
        2)Delay Javascript Loading : put script at the bottom of the page instead by the time our script starts loading there's at least some content
        on the page making the page seem to have loaded faster , An alternative is to use defer in the script tag the defer attribute specifies that the 
        script should be executed after the page has finished parsing but it only works for external script
        <!-- <script type="text/javascript" src="external.js" defer></script> -->
        3)use Switch Instead of lengthy if-then-else statements 
        4)get rid of unnessary loops and calls made inside loops
        5)minimize your code as much as you can : Bundling your application components into *.js files and passing them through a javascript
        minification tool will make your code cleaner there are tons of code minification tools that are available free.

    <h1>Debugging in Javascript</h1>
    <pre>
        Using debugger keyword: The debugger keyword is used in the code to force stop the execution of the code at a breaking point and calls
        the debugging function. The debugger function is executed if any debugging is needed at all else no action is performed 

        Use of console.log() method there is another way in which the JS value can be displayed in the debugger window 

        setting break point: The console.log( is good way to debug errors but setting breakpoint is a faster more efficient and better method
        In this method Breakpoint are set in code which stops the excetution of code at that point so that the values of variables can be examined
        at that time. Here are some advantages of using Breakpoint over the console.log() method
