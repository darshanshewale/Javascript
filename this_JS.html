    <h1>this keyword</h1>
    <pre>
        Javascript this keyword always holds the refrence to a single object which defines the current line of code's execution context 
        which means this keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the code.

        The value that this store is the current execution context of the javascript program 

        Thus when used inside a function this value will change depending on how that fucntion is defined how it is invoked and the 
        default execution context. this keyword will refer to different objects depending on how it is used 
    </pre>

    <h1>Implicit Binding</h1>
    <pre>
        When we call a function as a method of the object this keyword refers to the calling object 
    </pre>
    <script>
        const person ={
            name:"ram",
            age:22,
            greet:function()
            {
                return `hello ${this.name},you are ${this.age} years old`

            }

        }
        console.log(person.greet());
    </script>

    <h1>Explicit Binding</h1>
    <pre>
        When we explicitly bind this keyword using call() , bind() or apply() method then this keyword default refrence is changed  to 
        the object called using the above-specified method
    </pre>

    <script>
        function ageverify()
        {
            if(this.age>18)
            {
                console.log("Yes you can drive");
            }
            else
            {
                console.log("No you cannot drive");
            }       
         }
         const per1={age:21};
         const per2={age:16};
         ageverify.call(per1);
         ageverify.call(per2);

    </script>

        const age=22;

        function verify(){
